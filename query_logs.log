ANSWER: Please provide the context of the platform you are referring to. I need to know what platform you are using to give you a specific answer about the icons.

For example, if you are using a pathology learning platform, I might say:

"Please refer to the platform's help section or key. Often, there's a legend or guide that explains the meaning of each icon. If you can't find it, try hovering your mouse over the icon; a tooltip might appear with a description."

**To give you a useful answer, I need to know which platform you are asking about.**

ANSWER: Please provide the context of the platform you are referring to. I need to know what platform you're using (e.g., PathElective, a specific learning management system, etc.) to tell you what the icons mean.

**However, based on the examples you provided, I can give you a general answer:**

Answer: The platform likely uses a visual key or legend. Look for a section labeled "Help," "Key," "Legend," or a similar term. This section should explain the meaning of each icon used on the platform. If you can't find one, try hovering your mouse over the icon; a tooltip might appear with a description.
